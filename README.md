This GitHub file consists of the individual work contributing to the research mentioned above.<br>
NeuralNetsss.ipynb is a Colab notebook about the initial steps in the project's learning from different websites about Neural Networks and other concepts with the working implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.<be>
mridangamdataset.ipynb is where code from the compIAM is understood, and findings were compared of the CompIAM's and Ramanathan sir's datasets and some understanding was written in markdown in the same Kaggle notebook.
